# Collaboration
3th (and final) project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree program

## Instructions
Follow the instructions found in the MADDPG.ipynb to download the environment and play with the agents. 

## Environment 

![movie](https://github.com/rmnfournier/continuous_control/blob/master/reacher.gif)

Two agents control rackets to bounce a ball over a net. They receive a reward of +0.1 for hitting the ball over the net and a reward of -0.01 for letting the ball hit the ground or hitting it out of bounds. Thus, each agent wants to keep the ball in play as long as possible. Each agent perceive a state of dimensionality 24 and must take an action a $\in$ [-1,1]x[-1,1]. 

The goal is to get a minimum score of 0.5 on average over 100 episodic tasks, where the score for each task is the score of the best agent. 

## Training Curve
